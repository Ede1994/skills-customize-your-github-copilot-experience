### 🛠️ Build the Hangman Game

#### Description
Create a Hangman game where players guess letters to reveal a hidden word before running out of attempts. The game should provide feedback after each guess and track the player's progress.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Randomly select a word from a predefined list
- Accept letter guesses from the player and validate input
- Display current progress using underscores for unguessed letters (e.g., `_ _ _ _`)
- Track and display the number of incorrect guesses remaining
- End the game when the word is fully guessed (win) or attempts are exhausted (lose)
- Display appropriate win/lose messages at the end
